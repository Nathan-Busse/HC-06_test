Project: O.D.R.I.N mini 
Start date: 3 April 20223
Script name: Bluetooth_echo
Info:

This code tests that the HC-06 bluetooth module is working
 properly by establishing a connection between the 
 module and the device throough a 3rd party app called
 Bluetooth terminal and is developed by qwerty.

To determine that their is a successful handshake between 
the module and the device the user will enter a command via
the app to enable and disable built-in LED in pin 13.

When a recieved command has been proccessed successfuly,
the Arduino will echo a string to the app notifying
the user the command has been recieved and has been executed

Input commands:

LED on: "1" 
Return string: LED is ON.

LED off: "2"
Return string: LED is OFF.

HELP: "?"
Return string: Prints the executable input commands.
